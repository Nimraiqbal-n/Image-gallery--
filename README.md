# Image Gallery

## Overview
This project is a dynamic and interactive Image Gallery built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The gallery allows users to browse through a collection of images using "Previous" and "Next" buttons. The project showcases key front-end development skills such as responsive design, DOM manipulation, and event handling.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes including desktop, tablet, and mobile.
- **Interactive Controls**: Navigate through images using intuitive "Previous" and "Next" buttons.
- **Smooth Transitions**: Images appear and disappear with smooth transitions, enhancing the user experience.
- **Hover Effects**: Hovering over an image slightly enlarges it, adding visual interest.
- **JavaScript Logic**: The image navigation is controlled through JavaScript, dynamically updating the displayed image based on user interaction.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For structuring the layout of the gallery.
- **CSS**: For styling the gallery, including media queries for responsiveness and hover effects for interactivity.
- **JavaScript**: For handling the image navigation and updating the DOM.
